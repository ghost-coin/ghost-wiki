# Doing a Atomic Swap

## GHOST - ETH

To do a atomic swap both traders need to hold ETH, only is needed Ghost on the trader that wanna sell, and being online at same time.

Ghost-ETH exchange starts by funding a Script address with Ghost and by locking ETH in a smart contract. Secrets are exchanged between them, and then one trader is able to unlock ETH and the other one to send a transaction to unlock Ghost from the timelock script. As it can be shown this process demands both parties hold ETH to perform the swap. All this process is made automatically and trustless, you need to make sure that keep online until swap concludes.
