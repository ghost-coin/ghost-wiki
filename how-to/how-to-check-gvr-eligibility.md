# How to check gvr eligibility

This article teaches **Ghost Veterans** how to check their **Ghost Veteran Rewards \(GVR\)** eligibility.

Pre-requisite to qualify for 1 **Ghost Veteran** is 20 000 $GHOST in your Public Ghost Wallet. Each increment of 20 000 $GHOST adds another **Ghost Veteran**.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to Ghost Initiative GVR eligibility site: [http://ghostin.io/\#/GVR](http://ghostin.io/#/GVR).
2. Find your Ghost Wallet balance amount \(to the third decimal\) by scrolling through the live feed list. ![](https://ghostx.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/42696892/Wallet%20balance%202.png?version=2&modificationDate=1601226442515&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
